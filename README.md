Drunken Debuggers
-----------------

>"Your eyes are red from sleep deprivation.  
Your hands are shaking, the body is turning on its sirens of caffeine overdose.  
On the screen the debugger that once felt like home looks back at you angrily.  
You open another can of beer and close your eyes.   
As the cold nectar slips down your throat, your mind switches itself off for a moment.   
And when it comes back online, you finally get it.   
The instruction pointer shows 0x41414141."   

Drunken Debuggers is a workshop pattern that provides space, ideas and booze for those who want to sharpen their reversing, coding and drinking skills during hacking events.

We collect ideas for micro-projects which can be accomplished in a few hours and result in useful code or knowledge by themselves or combined. By providing a meeting platform for people with different skills and experience we encourage everyone to learn, teach and cooperate. To facilitate the communication and the sharing of thoughts between the participants the organizers provide some fine drinks for everyone who joins. 

General Rules
-------------

* Keep a good balance between Drinking and Debugging. If you need a break from any of these, feel free to have one!
* If you see someone's doing something great bring him/her a drink and clink glasses
* If you are stuck with a problem, ask your neighbors for help
  * Honor good ideas with drinks

Mini-Projects
-------------

* Anyone can propose a new project
* Anyone can start working on any project
* Teams are preferred to lone warriors
* Completed/Solved projects should be published under an open license
  * It is recommended to use Git so all finished projects can be forked under [the main DrunkenDebuggers repository](https://github.com/DrunkenDebuggers/)

Booze
-----

* Organizers take care of a basic supply of drinks and glasses
* Anyone can bring his own drink
* Contributing to the basic supply is always welcome
* Everyone is encouraged to invite others for drinks

Registration
------------

DrunkenDebuggers should always be free for anyone to join, but to prevent spamming/trolling and - more importantly - to help establishing personal contacts organizers are encouraged to require registrations in person.
